Nuke MP3 Player - The Best MP3 Player Of Them All (Atlest the ones that use the windows media player contol)
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

Hi All,

Thanx for dloadin my source! I wrote this about a year ago, so its a bit buggy and basic, but what can you expect when using the windows media player control. I wrote it with the intent to use it but i realise it could never be the next winamp so i never really used it. Feel free to fix/modify my code, but pls add my name into your credits please and drop me a mail.
